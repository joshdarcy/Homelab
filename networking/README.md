# Networking

Working primarily with pfSense, MicroTik & Ubiquiti, I feel quite confident in the implementation and troubleshooting of these brands.
I'm currently pursuing my CCNA and am trying to get more exposure to:
* Cisco IOS
* OpnSense
* Virtualized pfSense

## Projects
### Completed
* EdgeRouter-4 setup without using any wizards (including DDNS & functioning L2TP VPN)
* MicroTik hAP ax3 setup (including WiFi Wave 2)

### In Progress
* OpnSense Virtualized on Proxmox Host
* Container Networking through Docker
* Network Automation through Ansible
