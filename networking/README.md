# Networking

I've completed my CCNA certification and work day-to-day with vendors like Cisco, Aruba, Juniper and MikroTik.
I'm currently not completing any network-specific projects in my homelab and try to keep it minimally disruptive (for the gfs Plex enjoyment).

I've had some interesting network challenges implementing microservices but outside of basic network segregation, I try to keep my homelab network as simple as possible.

All external access to my network is managed by the Nginx Ingress Controller and secured with TLS & Cloudflare Proxy. Refer to the main repo README for more details.

I'll update this if I take on any interesting network projects.
